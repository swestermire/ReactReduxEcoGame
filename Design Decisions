TODO-1)
    File: game_date_component.js:
    Method: MapDispatchToProps -> updateLumberMarket:
    10-7-2017: Right now mapDispatchToProps is specifically updating one market.
    This should really be abstracted to update ALL markets.

    We could have a dispatched action dispatch multiple actions.
    Going to setup one action that goes through all actions

    What is process flow:
    Player's submit their demand and supply tickets -> WORLD MARKET ---
    -> (end of day) everything is recalculated


    (comment: Look into "Object Spread Operator"???)
    (comment: Immutable Datastructures???: Immutable.js)
    Ideally this is how it should be (Creating resources reducer)
    Resources Object:
        name : {name,
                 price,
                 supply,
                 demand}

    Created a Resources reducer (reducers/resources) using the Resource model above.

TODO-2) Hook up actions to newly created reducer.
        Going to update our action (actions/market) to connect to todo-1 resoures reducer.
